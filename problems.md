# SSL certificate problem (curl command)

![CURL](images/curl.JPG)

The problem was my Kaspersky antivirus! 

# ModuleNotFoundError

If you try to install SomePackage from PyPI and you get this error:

![pkg1](images/pkg1.JPG)

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named “pkg_resources” 

```
pip install -–force-reinstall -U setuptools
```

![pkg2](images/pkg2.JPG)

And now try again to install the SomePackage from PyPI.
